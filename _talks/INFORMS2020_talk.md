**Abstract**:
After the first outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) at Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it has spread globally across 188 countries. This pandemic situation has attracted many researchers' attention because of the novelty of the virus. In this study, we focus on researchers' collaborations on academic papers related to COVID-19 published in various journals across countries. By constructing the authors' collaboration networks involved in those papers, we discover the patterns newly found among the authors. More specifically, we focus on the diversity of the collaborating authors in terms of their research fields, cultures, and academic prestige to find the factors that contribute to the research papers' academic and public impacts.
