**Abstract**:
Online Health Communities (OHCs) are popular sources for patients and their families to get informational and emotional support related to the diseases or symptoms. As users interact with each other, they also form a social network. We try to predict the links that are likely to be formed in such a network to improve patients’ experience in an OHC. Our model considers the different types of relationships among users, users’ levels of online activities, as well as the topics of their online discussions. We show that our model outperforms benchmark methods in predicting future social network links.
