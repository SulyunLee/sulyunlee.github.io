**Abstract**:
Social networks often incorporate multiple types of social relationships, making them multi-relational networks. Effective link predictions can help social networks improve user experience and engagement, but limited attention has been paid to predicting links in multi-relational networks. This paper explores link predictions in multi-relational networks from an online health community. We demonstrate that leveraging information from multiple networks built based on different types of relationships is superior to using only information from a single network or the aggregated network. In addition, adding community structures, nodal similarities based on network embed- ding and topic similarity can help link predictions in different ways. Our work has implications for the design and management of a successful online health community.
