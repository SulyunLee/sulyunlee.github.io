## Basics of linear regression
Linear regression is a model that estimates the linear relationships between predictor variables and outcome variables.
The simplest form of a linear regression model is when there is a single predictor variable. Here, we find a line that best represents the data points by estimating a slop and an intercept. For example, assume that we would like to predict the years of progression for diabetes using the blood sugar level. We use a linear regression to find the line that best represents the data points as follows:
