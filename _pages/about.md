I joined Happiest Baby, Inc. in June 2022 as a Data Scientist in the AI team. As a Data Scientist, I worked on a project for predicting customer retention using state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques. I also worked on a research project that models infant sleep for better representing and measuring the quality of sleep using massive sleep logs. Collaborating with a marketing team and health researchers, I demonstrated data-driven insights on the outstanding performance of our company's products using statistical inferences.

Before joining the company, I pursued a Ph.D. degree in Informatics at the University of Iowa. My academic advisor was [Dr. Kang Zhao](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/people/kang-zhao) from the Department of Business Analytics. My research focused on data mining in social/business networks. Specifically, I proposed a novel Graph Neural Network model that predicts team performance in collaborative settings using the nature of team structures.
I also collaborated with professors and students with medical and pharmaceutical backgrounds. I analyzed the medical claims dataset to optimize treatment for heart attack patients using predictive modeling and provided data-driven insights for possible risk factors for genetic diseases.
