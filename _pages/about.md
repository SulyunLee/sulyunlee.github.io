I am a Ph.D. student in the Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Informatics (IGPI) at the University of Iowa. My current academic advisor is [Dr. Kang Zhao](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/people/kang-zhao) from the Department of Business Analytics. My research focuses on data mining in social/business networks. Specifically, I am interested in graph embedding techniques that learn the representations of networks using machine learning and deep learning architectures. I am currently working on a dissertation, "Representation Learning on Hierarchical Collaboration Networks," which is learning network embeddings on team collaboration networks with hierarchical command structures.

Besides applying data science skills to networks, I also love applying to diverse domains, such as medical, social, and management fields. I have much experience in collaborating with students and professors from different areas. These collaboration experiences taught me that data science skills are applicable to any domain and that the combination of data science and other domains could encourage intellectual stimulation, which leads to novel findings.
