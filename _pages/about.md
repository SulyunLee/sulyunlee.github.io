I am a Ph.D. student in the Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Informatics (IGPI) at the University of Iowa. My current academic advisor is [Dr. Kang Zhao](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/people/kang-zhao) from the Department of Business Analytics. My research focuses on data mining in social/business networks. Specifically, I am interested in graph embedding techniques that learn the representations of networks using machine learning and deep learning architectures. I have done several data science projects that are applied in various domains. I proposed a link prediction method to predict the future interactions among users in an online health community, explored the association between customer satisfaction and entrepreneur's business strategy in a crowdfunding platform, and discovered the association between research scholars' expertise and research success. Most recently, I am working on a project that proposes a novel Graph Neural Network model that predicts team performance in collaborative environments using teams' hierarchical structures.

I also collaborated with experts from medical and pharmaceutical backgrounds. I analyzed the medical claims dataset to optimize treatment for heart attack patients using predictive modeling and provided data-driven insights for possible risk factors for genetic disease carriers. These collaboration experiences taught me that data science skills are further applicable to medical domains by discovering unknown findings.
